Preface
-------

Some days ago, [I twitted about having MVC in both sides of development, server and client](https://twitter.com/#!/lucasts/status/189476751943024641)

  >So, we ended up with MVC in server side and client side. Is that good or bad?

days after that I  was reading about [Meteor](http://meteor.com/).

Can be things like Metheor the solution?

Wait, is there any problem that need a solution?


The Old, The New and What you we are doing today
------------------------------------------------

Bring some history to the table, in the not so old time ago, when web development was growing, the client side was not that important 
in the view of devevelopers and a good mess of HTML, JS, CSS, Tables and so on was not major problem.

On the server side, we can split things in amateur to regular business using vastly PHP and ASP solutions and Java on bigger companies/apps.

Some years of transition,  in the client we walk across many movements, like tableless, semantic web, better javascripts libraries, in the server
frameworks start to grow in maturity, making development a lot faster, nice things came out like Rails, Django and some small revolutions are poiting
to a good mix of fast protoypes with those frameworks and a much more concern about HOW to make things better with speed bring a good sauce of
programming patterns(think Rails 1 and Rails 3)

As today, a new project for a web application can be started fast but with good pratices both server and client side.
You pick some languague and framework that fits your taste to do the server side code and

But remember the cited tweet in the preface,


Problem?

- history
- the mix of today 
- future?
