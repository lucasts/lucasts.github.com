layout: post
---
Web development is moving fast, from client mess years ago we made a better way to do things. We are reaching the maximum that 
we can extract from the infrastructure(http, browsers, languages), but some is there yet to be improved. 

How will we develop in the next years without duplication of code and maintaining choices flexibility? 

Right path? Well, better it be.
